## definition

where do generics come in, and would it perhaps be something that would just be covered by possible macros?
would be nice in any case to not need angle braces for generics... or perhaps there some other delimiter that wont cause trivial undecidability issues in the lexer...

## compiler

decide between using haskell, elixir or rust.
while elixir would be fun, the server will use it, so perhaps tamper with haskell

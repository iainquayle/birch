## types

while first class types would be cool and the structs can be handled, enums prove and issue
if types were first class, they could merely be a struct, where all values are types, and the syntax stays the same.
however, enums, would break that syntax.
two options, either keep types in a seperate space and not usable at runtime which would be an issue for runtime comp
or, perhaps the | x: y | z: w syntax returns a whole new type, which can obvioudly be then a member of a struct.
second options best ^
